After downloading it, you need to open your terminal (MacOS) to follow these simple instruptions for *unzipping the folder*. That is the easiest way to get to open the App.
One step at a time, you should:
::

    cd Downloads/
    unzip QuickdataLoad.app.zip
    cd dist/QuickdataLoad.app/Contents/MacOS
    ./QuickdataLoad

If you followed the steps correctly, you should get an output to wait while downloading. In a few moments the QuickdataLoad App window should appear to get things started.
