After installing the **SmartData Tool App** a new window will appear, as shown below. The main purpose is to be able to execute commands according to the desired Logon information and Input Data.

As an example we can extract data by just choosing the program type and browsing into your computer to allocate the desired output file. That means, the main process of retrieving data out of the program source to an output file will be executed.
